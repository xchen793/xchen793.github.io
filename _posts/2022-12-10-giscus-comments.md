## 1. TDA Pipeline
    1. The input is assumed to be a finite set of points with a notion of distance - or similarity - between them. The distance can be 1) induced by the metric in the ambient space(e.g. 2D? 3D?) or 2) an intrinsic metric defined by a pairwise distance matrix.
    2. 

## 2. Metric Space

\textbf{Def 2.1}: A metric space ($$M$$, $$\rho$$) is a set $$M$$ with a function $$\rho : M \times M \rightarrow \mathcal{R}_{+}$$, such that $$ \forall x, y, z \in M$$
