## TDA Pipeline
    1. The input is assumed to be a finite set of points with a notion of distance - or similarity - between them. The distance can be 1) induced by the metric in the ambient space(e.g. 2D? 3D?) or 2) an intrinsic metric defined by a pairwise distance matrix.
    2. 

## Metric Space
A metric space ($M$, $\rou$) is a set $M$ with a function $\rou : M \times M \rightarrow \mathcal{R}_{+}$


## Covers


## Simplicial Complexes
