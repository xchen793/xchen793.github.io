This is Xuanzhou Chen. I am currently a MS student at NYU. My research interests lie in the intersection of :
1. Trustworthy Machine Learning 
2. Information Theory 
3. Machine Learning Theory 
4. Natural Language Processing 
5. Applied Crptography  

Specifically, I am exploring some research problems as following: 
1. How to make language models more robust against adversarial perturbations via information-theoretic approaches?  
2. How to make machine learning model more computational efficient? 
3. How to mitigate the inherant bias in training dataset while deploying ML/DL model?
